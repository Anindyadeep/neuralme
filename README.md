# neuralme

In this project I have tried to make a web app with the help of streamlit that will run the scratch neural network model in the backend, and will train itself with 4 datasets and will give some cool, clear visualisations with the graphs, accuracy loss curves in both training and validations sets. I will also update this web app time to time. There are also several more changes to make. Using version 1.0.0
